The analysis involves three parts. 

## 1. Sequencing data analysis of ZJU patients

Within-host diversity and mutation dynamics from a collection of 149 early clinical samples from 66 patients

## 3. Epidemiological analysis

Epidemiological features and evolution history of the two mutations using ~5.5 million high-quality sequences from the GISAID database
